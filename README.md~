Tiled
http://www.mapeditor.org/

The map editor Tiled produce files in .tmx format which is xml-based.

This library and its classes allow the loading of tmx files into a TileMapData object, and
allow the creating of an Android Bitmap based on said TileMapData object

USAGE
-----

src/davidiserovich/TMXLoader/ contains the main source files.
assets/ contains an example tmx file and its tileset image.

The entire directory structure is a regular Eclipse Android project,
and can be imported.

The main activity TMXLoaderActivity uses the TileMapData object and
Canvas to create a Bitmap containing the arrangment of tiles that
the tmx specifies.

FEATURE RESTRICTIONS/TODO

- The only tilemap layout supported is 0 border, 0 margins, 0 spacing.

- Map objects are not yet supported.

- Tile rotations are not yet supported.

- The only supported data format is CSV
(This can be set in Tiled in Edit->Preferences->Store Tile Data As: CSV)
